PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT (PRD)
Project: MedTrack — Elderly-Friendly Medication Reminder App
Platform: Android (Kotlin, Android Studio)
Version: 1.0 — Offline-first (SQLite with Room), optional cloud sync future
1. Purpose & Problem Statement

Elderly individuals frequently forget to take medicines on time, struggle with managing multiple prescriptions, and may have difficulty interacting with complex interfaces.

The purpose of MedTrack is to:

Provide simple, reliable medication reminders.

Reduce cognitive load via clean, minimal UI.

Offer granular scheduling (timing, dosage, stomach condition).

Allow quick confirmation (“Taken” button).

Work offline, with high reliability, using SQLite as the local database.

Prepare the architecture for future cloud sync / caregiver supervision.

2. Target Users
Primary Users

Elderly individuals (60–90+)

Those with limited smartphone literacy

Users with poor vision / cognitive difficulty

Secondary Users (future)

Caregivers

Family members

Doctors/pharmacists during medication setup

3. Design Principles

5.3 Low Battery Warning

If battery < 20%, display a reminder:
“Low battery may delay medication alarms.”

6. Technical Requirements
6.1 Architecture

MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)

Repository pattern

Single source of truth: SQLite (Room)

Use WorkManager for scheduling background sync tasks

Use AlarmManager for reliable alarms

6.2 Database Schema (Room)
Table: medications
id: UUID
name: TEXT
dosage: TEXT
stomach_condition: TEXT
start_date: DATE
end_date: DATE (nullable)
frequency_type: TEXT (daily, hourly, selected_days)
frequency_value: INTEGER (for every-X-hours)
notes: TEXT (nullable)
created_at: TIMESTAMP
updated_at: TIMESTAMP

Table: medication_times

(each medicine can have multiple times)

id: UUID
medication_id: UUID (FK)
time_of_day: TEXT ("08:00")

Table: intake_logs
id: UUID
medication_id: UUID
scheduled_time: TIMESTAMP
taken_time: TIMESTAMP (nullable)
status: TEXT (MISSED, TAKEN, SKIPPED)
created_at: TIMESTAMP

Future-proofing for sync

Add these optional fields (not active yet):

remote_id: TEXT (nullable)
is_synced: BOOLEAN

6.3 Alarms & Scheduling Logic
Alarm Scheduling Rules:

On app startup → initialize all alarms

On new medicine added → schedule

On edit → reschedule

On delete → cancel alarms

Alarm Triggers:

10 min before → notification

Exact time → full alarm

Exact-time delivery:

Use AlarmManager.setExactAndAllowWhileIdle()

6.4 Accessibility Requirements

Text size minimum 18sp

High-contrast mode toggle

Voice announcements optional

Haptic feedback required for buttons

Touch target minimum 48dp

Multi-language support (English first)
